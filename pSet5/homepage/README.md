# Homepage Instructions


## tl;dr
Build a simple homepage using HTML and CSS.


## Specification
Implement in your `homepage` directory a website that must:
- Contain at least four different `.html` pages, at least one of which is `index.html` (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
- Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`. Using some tag (e.g., `<p>`) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
- Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See Bootstrap’s documentation to get started. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include: `<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">` in your pages' `<head>`, below which can `<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">` containing your own CSS.
- Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, `styles.css`, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (`example`), class (`.example`), or ID (`#example`)), and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as `font-size`, or `margin`; and
- Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.
- No need to include any JavaScript on your site for this problem set, unless so inclined!
