# Speller Instructions


## tl;dr
Implement a program that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

## Specification
The challenge now before you is to implement, in order, `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, and `unload` as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that `TIME IN load`, `TIME IN check`, `TIME IN size`, and `TIME IN unload` are all minimized.
- You may not alter `speller.c` or `Makefile`.
- You may alter `dictionary.c` (and, in fact, must in order to complete the implementations of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, and `unload`), but you may not alter the declarations (i.e., prototypes) of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, or `unload`. You may, though, add new functions and (local or global) variables to `dictionary.c`.
- You may change the value of `N` in `dictionary.c`, so that your hash table can have more buckets.
- You may alter `dictionary.h`, but you may not alter the declarations of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, or `unload`.
- Your implementation of `check` must be case-insensitive. In other words, if `foo` is in dictionary, then `check` should return true given any capitalization thereof; none of `foo`, `foO`, `fOo`, `fOO`, `fOO`, `Foo`, `FoO`, `FOo`, and `FOO` should be considered misspelled.
- Capitalization aside, your implementation of `check` should only return `true` for words actually in dictionary. Beware hard-coding common words (e.g., the), lest we pass your implementation a `dictionary` without those same words. Moreover, the only possessives allowed are those actually in `dictionary`. In other words, even if `foo` is in `dictionary`, `check` should return `false` given `foo's` if `foo's` is not also in `dictionary`.
- You may assume that any `dictionary` passed to your program will be structured exactly like ours, alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with `\n`. You may also assume that `dictionary` will contain at least one word, that no word will be longer than `LENGTH` (a constant defined in `dictionary.h`) characters, that no word will appear more than once, that each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe.
- You may assume that `check` will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes.
- Your spell checker may only take `text` and, optionally, `dictionary` as input. Although you might be inclined (particularly if among those more comfortable) to “pre-process” our default dictionary in order to derive an “ideal hash function” for it, you may not save the output of any such pre-processing to disk in order to load it back into memory on subsequent runs of your spell checker in order to gain an advantage.
- Your spell checker must not leak any memory. Be sure to check for leaks with `valgrind`.
- You may search for (good) hash functions online, so long as you cite the origin of any hash function you integrate into your own code.
